## Lab 1: Infrastructure & Environment Setup

### Executive Summary
I have established a secure, version-controlled technical workbench on a local Ubuntu VM. This environment is integrated with Git and GitHub to serve as a persistent "Portfolio of Evidence" for the Cybersecurity Foundations Intensive.

### Technical Tasks Completed
* **Identity Management:** Configured global Git credentials to ensure all technical logs are digitally signed.
* **Infrastructure Audit:** Generated a system verification report (`setup_verify.txt`) confirming the successful installation of Git, Python3, and secure network routing.
* **Version Control Handshake:** Established a secure push/pull communication channel between the local workbench and the remote GitHub vault.

### Toolset
* **OS:** Ubuntu Linux (Oracle VirtualBox)
* **VCS:** Git 2.43.0 
* **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
